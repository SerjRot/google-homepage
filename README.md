In this small project i use all my HTML and CSS and GIT knowledge to do something. That all, finally starting to create something. I don't know what yet.
I hope i'll read this readme in a few months and take a good laugh of how alienated i felt writing thing.

	Didn't know how to save a file in Vim so i pressed Ctrl+Z and got out of text editor with the file unsaved, sp i thought i lost the text above.
After googling the commands found out that after writing i can pres ESC then write commands of what i want to happen with this file. Like :wq which means write and quit, like save and quit. And from command mode to move back to insert text all i have to do is to pres "i".

I still have the previous text because when i tried again to edit this file, Vim told me that does exist a unrecovered file of this one, pointing to the one that i close prematurly with Ctrl+z. And i had the option to recover it.

Iuhuuuu. I learn slow, bu I LEARN!!
